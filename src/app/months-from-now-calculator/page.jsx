                        project due for school. Your teacher told you that the
                        project is due exactly 7 months from today (let's assume
                        today is August 8, 2023).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You're excited about this project and want to make sure
                        you plan your time effectively. You decide to use the
                        Months From Now Calculator to find out the exact due
                        date. Just enter a number in the input field above.
